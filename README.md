# Customer Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on customer data analysis, where we have performed data cleaning and manipulation, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal of this analysis is to improve customer experience and boost sales by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups. Additionally, we have also pinpointed the most selling product categories and products, which can assist in inventory planning to meet customer demands more effectively.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: We started by cleaning and manipulating the raw data to make it suitable for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we delved into the data to gain insights and answer critical questions about our customers and products.

- **Customer Segmentation**: We segmented customers based on their demographic information, including age, gender, state, occupation, and more. This helps us better understand our customer base.

- **Sales Analysis**: We identified the most selling product categories and individual products. This information can be invaluable for inventory planning and marketing strategies.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

- **Data Cleaning**: Detailed data cleaning steps to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and insights gained from exploring the dataset.

- **Customer Segmentation**: Analysis of customer segments based on various attributes.

- **Sales Analysis**: Insights into product categories and specific products that are top sellers.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Cust_name**: Customer's name.
- **Product_ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (M/F).
- **Age Group**: Age group category.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Marital_Status**: Customer's marital status (0 - Single, 1 - Married).
- **State**: Customer's state of residence.
- **Zone**: Geographical zone of residence.
- **Occupation**: Customer's occupation.
- **Product_Category**: Category of the purchased product.
- **Orders**: Number of orders placed.
- **Amount**: Total amount spent by the customer.
- **Status**: Additional status information.
